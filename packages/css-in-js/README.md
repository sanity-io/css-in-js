# ⚠️ Performance-focused styled-components forks

> **Important**: [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io) is not actively maintaining these packages long-term. We're transitioning away from CSS-in-JS solutions to [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/). These forks exist to help the community during the transition period after styled-components [ceased active maintenance](https://opencollective.com/styled-components/updates/thank-you).

[See the README for more information.](https://github.com/sanity-io/styled-components-last-resort#readme)
